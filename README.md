# Malloc-Implementation

Spring 21. Done in collaboration with Yaal Lekach Avivi.

As a final assigment in Operating Systems course we implemented the Mallocs' familiy functions: malloc, calloc, realloc and free.
Taken into consideration the efficiency, we implemeneted our own data structures and helper functions to control memory managment, split and unite of data blocks.
